# "Making £502,835 is easy."

"It’s easy."

That’s what Adam Cheng said to me when I first asked him how he’s made £502,835 profit betting on football over the last three years.

"Easy??" I said. "But HOW exactly do you do it??"

Adam shrugged.

"I dunno. I don’t really do anything, I just kind of know."

Just kind of know…

Okay, I had to find out more. Adam must be doing something different to be making that much money, and so consistently over such a long time.

I mean, take a look at his track record:

| Month/Year              | Profit       | Cumulative         |
| ----------------------- | ------------ | ------------------ |
| May 2017                | £20,000      | £20,000            |
| June                    | £10,000      | £30,000            |
| July                    | £15,000      | £45,000            |
| August                  | £5,000       | £50,000            |

And here are a few of his winners...

So, I asked Adam to show me exactly what he was doing to find his bets.

And he agreed. Some bettors like to keep their secrets secret, but Adam was happy to show me his entire process.

He still didn’t think he was doing anything special.

He said, "It’s just common sense stuff, really."

But, as he opened up his spreadsheets, took me through the websites he uses, and explained his strategy and core philosophy, and the psychology behind what he was doing…

I just laughed!

This is NOT "just common sense stuff" – this is huge news for so many punters out there.

# Original insights, not in the public domain.

Here's a concrete tactic no one else knows about that Adam uses to get an edge on two obscure markets:

He opens up a little-known app on his mobile (with only 200 reviews on the Apple Store) and counts up these "weird arrows"...

![trimmedarrow](/img/trimmedarrow.png)

![trimmedarrow](/img/weirdarrows.png)

The knowledge this gives Adam is unavailble anywhere else.

No stats website has this info autogenerated.

No bookmaker either.

And it allows him to see exactly where the odds are out on two markets. 

This tactic is how Adam gets hist bigget edge over bookmakers.

That's why he routinely stakes £500+ on these "weird arrow" bets.

But smaller stakes would see an impressive profit following this strategy - the benefit of information simply not out ther in the public domain.

For example, since 2019 BetChat's Josh Allen has been investing a small part of betting portfolio in to this strategy and he's made £6,627:

![josharrows](/img/josharrows.png)

He says:

> This simple strategy is as close to a betting money tree as you’ll ever find.

You'll learn Adam's "weird arrow" strategy - for not one, but two markets - in Lesson 7 of Adam's masterclass.

# Too many online courses focus on the wrong things:

- Short videos that promote surface level understanding

- Production value over valuable content

- Canned scripts that feel impersonal and robotic

- Video camera pointing at somebody’s face (I’m not learning a lot from your eyebrows…)

- And slides, slides, ENDLESS slides (did I mention slides?)

No one should be paying a premium price for a glorified PowerPoint presentation.

Especially if all you’re left with is surface level understanding and no real skill development.

Working with Adam, I knew we could create something better than "the average".

**Adam's Football Betting Masterclass** takes everything 

Our focus is on the insight our professional bettors have to offer YOU.

I dig into their most secret betting knowledge, strategies and practice.

And share every stage of that process of discovery.

Then turn it into practical tactics and strategies you can implement in your own betting.

That’s why each lesson in Adam's masterclass includes a mix of:

## Audio Discussions

Bet Mentor uncensored audio discussions are the CORE of the entire experience.

You see, working with professional bettors for 7+ years, I've discovered that their most valuable insights arise through discussion.

The thing is, many of the professionals Bet Mentor works with have been making a living from betting for years (and years, and years, and years!).

So, much of their process and strategy have become instinctual.

They don’t have to think about what they’re doing, it’s just second nature.

In fact, for some of these pros, the experience of working with Bet Mentor will be the first time they’ve EVER had to explain exactly what they do to someone who isn’t a professional bettor.

And it’s through this discussion – with me asking all the questions under the sun! – that the most valuable insights are uncovered.

This is where the real value is for you. It's these insights that are going to help you make more money from betting.
And it’s why I'm giving you full access to the entire process.

Not some shiny PowerPoint slide presentation.

Yes, that means our audio discussions are a bit rough and ready.

But they are packed full of advice on strategy, psychology, tactics, everything you could want to know, DIRECT from the professionals.

## Practical Guides

There's a guide fore each lesson.

And each guide contains:

- Main takeawways (Adam's most important advice and insights)

- Do this (actionable strategies based on that lesson's focus)

- Highlights (the best quotes from Adam for that lesson)

- Timestamps (so you can easily find specific topics in the audio dicussion)

## Video Walktrhooughs

## Highlight Clips

## Quick-Start Tools

AKA the spreadsheet. 

# Everything you're getting

Altogether the content in the 7 lessons amounts to:

- 10 hours 53 mins 12 secs of audio discussion

- 10,8989 of pages of practical guides

- 47 highlight clips

- 6 hours of video walkthrough

- 2 quick start tools

Breathe!

I know, that's a lot of content.

But you can take things at your own pace.

And the audio discussions can be listened to wherever you are and whatever else you're doing - whether you're driving, cooking dinner, or just lieing on the sofa.

## A Quick Warning

This isn’t for everyone.

In fact, I imagine most people will be put off by the idea of a betting that requires some work (and this does).

If you’re someone who just wants to follow someone else’s tips for the rest of your betting career (and that’s absolutely fine) then this probably isn’t for you.

This masterclass is designed for a different audience…

People like our early access member Neel Shah, who has recently gone full-time with his betting. 

As Neel says…

“The core of the course was about learning. There were actionable strategies that were simple to understand that could be applied straight away

I really liked the homework exercises and recommended reading. This gave the course and the air of academics and reinforce the idea that this is something that requires effort and cannot be followed by blindly”
