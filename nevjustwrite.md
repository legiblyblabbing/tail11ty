# Why making £502,835 "is easy"

"It's easy."

That's what pro football punter Adam Cheng said to me when I first asked him how he had made £502,835 over the last 3 years.

We were in a greasy spoon in London Bridge and I couldn't believe what I was hearing.

"Easy? But how exactly do you do it?" I replied.

"I dunno. I don’t really do anything, I just kind of know."

Just kind of know...

Okay, I had to find out more.

After 7 years of writing for tens of professional bettors, and even pro investors, none of them could hold a candle to the kind of profits Adam was making.

He must be doing *something* differently.

I mean, since 2017 he has:

* sustained a **full-time living** from betting

* banked a total of **£500,000**

* averaged **£21,951** per month

* made **£73,000** in a single month

* had **28 out of 31** winning months 

So, I asked Adam to show me exactly what he was doing.

And, because he still didn't think he was doing anything special, he agreed.

He said, "It’s just common sense stuff, really."

But, after five minutes

I just laughed!

# This was not "just common sense stuff" – this would be huge news to so many punters.

I’ve been writing for professional bettors for over 7 years now.

And I’d never heard anyone else talk about some of the stuff Adam was sharing with me.

For example, while the rest of the world is obsessed with algorithms and robots…

Every Monday morning Adam opens up a little-known app on his phone (it only has 200 reviews on the app store)...

And manually counts up a

Like this:

</div>

This gives him an edge on two marktes

Why?

Because the bookmakers are using that simply average 

Here are some profits Adam's made using this "weird arrow" strategy...

</div>
<div class="shadow-md">

![adambet3](/img/adambet3.png)

</div>

This tactic is how Adam gets hist bigget edge over bookmakers.

That's why he routinely stakes £500+ on these "weird arrow" bets.

But smaller stakes would see an impressive profit following this strategy - the benefit of information simply not out ther in the public domain.

For example, since 2019 BetChat's Josh Allen has been investing a small part of betting portfolio in to this strategy and he's made £6,627:

He says:

> This simple strategy is as close to a betting money tree as you’ll ever find.

You'll learn Adam's "weird arrow" strategy - for not one, but two markets - in Lesson 7 of Adam's masterclass.

# Too many betting courses focus on the wrong things. 


# Welcome to Adam Cheng's Football Betting Masterclass.

### Sit down with pro punter Adam Cheng as he teaches you step-by-step how to make £20,951 per month (without getting banned).

Adam Cheng quit his job and started betting full-time in May 2017.

This was a huge risk, as he was the main bread-winner for his wife and young daughter.

But despite this pressure, he has:

* sustained a **full-time living** from betting

* banked a total of **£500,000**

* averaged **£21,951** per month

* made **£73,000** in a single month

* had **28 out of 31** winning months

Now he's ready to share every step of his betting process with a handful of driven people who want to take their betting game to the next level.
