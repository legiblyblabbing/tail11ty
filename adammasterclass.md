# Welcome to Adam Cheng's Football Betting Masterclass.

### Sit down with pro punter Adam Cheng as he teaches you step-by-step how to make £20,951 per month (without getting banned).

Adam Cheng quit his job and started betting full-time in May 2017.

This was a huge risk, as he was the main bread-winner for his wife and young daughter.

But despite this pressure, he has:

- sustained a **full-time living** from betting

- banked a total of **£500,000**

- averaged **£21,951** per month

- made **£73,000** in a single month

- had **28 out of 31** winning months

Now he's sharing every step of his betting process with a handful of driven people who want to take their betting game to the next level.

## What will I get out of this?

Here are the goals of Adam's masterclass:

- Teach you every step of Adam's betting process

- Show you how he makes thousands per month without getting restricted

- Help you get off the tipster merry-go-round and learn to make betting decisions yourself

- Show you how to use the laws of probability as a mental superpower for betting consistently

- Give you access to a community of fellow students who are learning to use Adam's methods together

- Rinse every ounce of betting knowledge out of Adam and deliver it to you in practical, easy to follow steps

- Give you full access to the 'behind the scenes' discussions between me and Adam, so no valuable insight is hidden

- Supply you with tools to help automate parts of Adam's strategy

## What is a 'masterclass'?

It's a learning program designed to break down exactly how a master of a specific skill does what they do, so you can learn from the best to improve your own skill.

In this case, Adam will share with you every step of his betting process, from the philosophies that underpin every bet he makes, to his exact strategies, and everthing in bterween.

No rock is left unturned. By the end of this masterclass you will know how to bet exactly like Adam, who makes an average of £20,951 per month.

### Audio discussion

what
why
how

This is the core of each lesson.

The core of each lesson is an in-depth audio discussion between me and Adam.

I ask him every, and persue him on the most valuable insights.

Rather than a scripted video with canned superficial information, you get to hear mine and Adam's full uncensored discussion.

This is the full 'behind the scenes' experience.

After 7 years working with professional bettors and quizzing them on their approaches, I discovered that the most valuable insights arise through discussion.

That's becausse often pros like Adam are so immersed in what they do, what seems like "common knowledge" to them turns out to be a hugely valuable insight for regular punters.

For example, during Lesson 6's audio dicscussion Adam mentioned how he uses restricted accounts to manipulate bookmaker odds and add up to £80 profit to his bets, "free money" as he called it.

To him this was no big deal, but to me (and the average punter) this was hugely exciting.

I mean, who wouldn't want to trick bookmakers into adjusting their odds so you can add £80+ to your profit?

Thanks to this unscripted discussion I was able to take this gem and turn it into a mini strategy that shows you the exact steps to do this.

You'll find it in the "Do this" section of the guide for Lesson 6.

Another benefit of the audio format is that you can listen to these parts of the lessons wherever you are.

Driving, washing up, relaxing on the sofa... on the toilet...

Stick a pair of headphones in and the whole world can become your learning playground!

### Guide

This is where I turn Adam's insights, advice, and strategies into practical, easy to follow steps you can implement in your own betting.

Each guide is made up of these sections:

- **"Main takeaways"**
  
  This is where I summarise Adam's key insights from the lesson in easy to digest bullet points

- **"Do this"**
  
  Here I turn Adam's advice into step-by-step mini strategies and excecises to help reifnorce his teachings and make sure you can implement them in your own betting as easily as possible

- **"Read this"**
  
  This is where I provide extra learning material or links to software that can help you further understand and implement Adam's teachings

- **"What's next?"**
  
  A quick tease of what you'll discover in the next lesson (which, if you like, you can get stuck into straight awway)

- **"Highlight reel"**
  
  Adam's most important and insightful quotes from the discussion. I've also made every quote into audio clips you can listen to for quick-fire inspiration and advice

- **"Timestamps"**
  
  A list of the topics we talk about in the audio discussion and at what times

The "Main takeaways" and "Do this" sections are where you'll find the main bulk of the action in the guides.

But the extra reading is hugely valuable too.

Think of it like an ongoing reading club where we explore interesting (and sometimes wacky) ideas that give you new 'lenses' to look at your betting through.

### Video walkthrough

The first 6 lessons have video walkthroughs with me.

I break down the main takweays for each lesson, summarise Adam's advice, and walk you through the practical actions to take to improve your own betting found in the guide.

The 7th lesson, where we breakdown Adam's main strategy step-by-step includes video wlakthroughs with Adam.

I thought this would be the best way to show you exactly how Adam implements these strategies himself.

### Highlight clips

These audio clips are bite-size outtakes from the main audio discussion.

They're the most impactful and valuable insights Adam shared in the lesson.

If you ever need a rerfresher on a lesson, or just some quick-fire advice from Adam, you can play a few of these clips.

Yep, you'll be able to improve your betting in as little as 60 seconds!

### Tools

Okay, these are more like SUPER spreadsheets.

But seriously... they're actually very exciting!

One is an exact replica of Adam's spreadsheet, so you can fill it out as he does (instructions are in the first few lessons).

The other is a walkthrough of specific bet examples with all accompanying stats for Lesson 7.

With some DIY templates for some content

They also house a but load of data

!! Go and have a look at them you idiot!!

### Private Chat

Plus, you'll receive an invite to join our private Telegram community.

This is where we work as a group to implement Adam's advice and strategies.

And also test out new ideas.

We have two pro punters already part of the group, so the level of insight being shared is top notch.

See the later section on this page, [Can I chat with other students?](#), for more info on the community.

**Goal:**

To show you all the tactics, strategies and tactics Adam uses t omake £20,951 without getting restricted by the bookmakers

After seeing Adam's track record of making an average of
£20,951 per month, one of our early access members asked,
"How is Adam able to generate this income WITHOUT getting
restricted?" It's a VERY GOOD question because the bookies are
becoming ever more aggressive with their banning and restricting
of accounts. So, I asked Adam, and, boy, does he have some
tricks up his sleeve for dealing with the bookies!

**What you'll learn:**

- How to "prime" accounts to appear like a mug punter

- The bookies special "ranking" system (are you an "A" or an "E"?)

- How Adam "mixes" bets to go under the radar

- The details of Adam's WhatsApp group account holder network

- The ONE factor the bookies are looking out for (it's not winners)

- How to keep single accounts open for as long as possible

- How to get people queuing up to open new accounts for you

- Adam's favourite bookmakers (and the ones you should avoid)

- Why betting shops are an overlooked gold mine

- Why you DON'T want to just bet on niche markets

- How Adam tricks brokers with "emotional" language

- Why Adam waits for (slightly) WORSE odds

- Why Adam NEVER refers bets

- The best way to spread bets across MULTIPLE accounts

- How to avoid bookies linking accounts

- Adam's two business plans for his account holders

- How Adam won his mate enough to redevelop his garden

- Why you should NEVER bet on a one-side priced market

- Why good bookies keep accounts open LONGER

- Why Adam says Betfair is a "must have" (not just for betting on)

- How to use Betfair to spot NEW bets

- Why you should make all your bets at once

- How to ride syndicate money to disguise your bets

- The magic of betting shop machines
  
- Plus a whole lot more

**Action "Do this" steps:**

1. How to start your own "Bets 'R' Us" business
2. How to spread out your bets across multiple accounts
3. Some questions to think about

**Additional learning:**

I share 5 lessons from my favourite famous bettor, who's insights line up with Adam's advice

## Can I see Adam's full track record?

Sure:

| Month/Year   | Profit       | Cumulative   |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| May 2017     | £20,000      | £20,000      |
| June         | £10,000      | £30,000      |
| July         | £15,000      | £45,000      |
| August       | £5,000       | £50,000      |

And here are some betting slips from some of his bets:

Remember, Adam stakes big because he's so confident in his edge.

But even with smaller stakes, his strategies are hugely profitable/

For example, the above bets would have...

Turned £15 into **£234**.

£75 into **£678**.

And £150 into **£783**.

## Can anyone do this?

Actually, no.

Adam's masterclass is not designed for the average punter.

Sure, everyone will find it interesting - and maybe simply listening to the audio discussions between me and Adam will be enough for some people.

But really, the masterclass is designed for people who want to take t

Adam's masterclass is tailor-made for you.

As our early access member Neel says:

<div class="bg-indigo-50 p-4 text-center shadow-md">

### *"The core of the course was about learning. There were actionable strategies that were simple to understand that could be applied straight away.*

### *"I really liked the homework exercises and recommended reading. This gave the course and the air of academics and reinforce the idea that this is something that requires effort and cannot be followed by blindly"*
Masterclass student, Neel Shah

</div>

Something

## How about if I only stake small?

Adam often bets with £500+.

This is because he's extremely confident in the edge he has (the same one he helps you develop throughout his masterclass).

But there's no reason for you to bet with such big stakes.

In fact, Adam actually says that smaller stakes are better for his approach.

There are two reasons for this:

!

Because much of Adam's profits come from two niche markets there's a limit to the size of bets you can get on (£500 is about the realistic limit) without getting flagged by the bookmakers.

But if you have a smaller account:

1. You can get more of your relative bank account on
2. Maybe there is only one reason

!Can you find a quote from him somewhere?

## What if my accounts are restricted?

This is a huge issue all bettors are facing right now.

And as bookmakers trade slamming down the ban hammer over improving their pircing game, it looks like it's only going to get worse.

The good news is in Lesson 3 Adam shares all his 

While, yes, his accounts eventually get restricted, since 2017 he's been able to sustain making an average of £20,951 per month.

So, he knows many tricks and techniques for keeping accounts open and flying under the bookmakers radar for as long as possible.

We go into this in-depth in **Lesson 3: How Adam Dodges the Bookie Ban Hammer** (this was actually indended to be a later lesson, but an early access member requested it be brought forward, so I know it's a hot issue for many people),

Also, if you're current accounts are restrcited, Adam shows you exactly how he gets hold of new ones - and even how to create a profitable "mini business" out of it.

Again, this is all in Lesson 3 of the masterclass.

## Can I chat with other students?

No speaking in class!

Only joking.

We have a private Telegram group for students.

Several things go on in here.

First of all, we help each other implement Adam's strategies.

As you can see, two of the members made profits on their first bets using Adam's "weird arrow" strategy...

!

Second, we share new insights and as we make progress...

!

And with Josh Allen and Neel as part of the group, there's a lot of expert knowledge and enthusiasm knocking around.

Surrouding yourself with the right people is half of winning the betting game.

And we're building a community of bettors who want to take things to the next level and have fun while they're doing it.

You're welcome to join us.

## Who are you?

My name's Duncan Moreland.

I don't expect you to have heard of me, although I've been part of the betting industry for going on 8 years now.

I'm what they call a "ghost writer" because I write on behalf of professional bettors (and investors in the finance world) in their names.

I've written on behalf horse racing tipsters Miles Tredwell, Mel Gee, and Nick Pullen, Football Index tipster Adam Gibbs, BetChat's Josh Allen (when he's too busy down the boozer), plus plenty of anonymous tipsters in greyhound racing, golf, tennis, and even pokemon battles... OK, maybe not that last one.

I've also written on behalf of some bigwig financial investors, including New York Times best-selling authors Jim Rickards and James Altucher.

In other words, I've been knocking around this industry for quite a while.

But this is one of the first projects where I've brought myself into the mix in a small way.

I'm no professional bettor so I act as the 'idiot' who Adam has to explain every part of his betting process to in simple, easy to follow language.

This means that anyone, no matter their experience, can approach this masterclass and follow Adam's advice.

Especially as I've made sure to turn every ounce of it into practical, easy to follow steps in the guides and video walkthroughs.

I wanted to make the masterclass as transparent and genuine as possible.

I chose Adam because he's simply the mot impressive person I've worked with in terms of making money consistently from what they do.

I knew his insight would be invaluable to the average punter.

I saw my job when making the masterclass with Adam to push him for his deepest insights and then translate every last ounce of advice he shared into practical

I really poured all my effort into making this masterclass the best it could be for anybody who chooses to give it a go.

It's packed to brim with practical insights, advice and strategies that will change the way you think about betting.

And I'm proud of what me and Adam have managed to put together for you.

## How much is this?

£250+VAT.

Which is just shy of £300.

There you go, no messing about hiding the price!

If that seems a little steep, consider two things:

1. You may never need to subscribe to a tipster again.

The average tipster service is £47 per month.

Subscrube to one for a year and that's

The content

And you're getting a truckload of content here.

Remember,

All designed to take your betting to the next level.

As I say, this won't be for everyone.

But for the right person it's an absolute bargain.

As our member Neel says, !"quote from Neel"

By the way, I use Gumroad as a payment processor and they display the price at checkout in dollars, but you'll be billed in sterling.

## Can I pay in installments?

Sure, I set up a 3-part payment option for one of our early access members.

At £ZZ per month, it works out slightly more expensive than buying the masterclass in one go.

But I understand that due to the cornovirus the year has been financially tough on many people, so this option is here if you want it.
