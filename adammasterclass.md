# Welcome to Adam Cheng's Football Betting Masterclass.

### Sit down with pro punter Adam Cheng as he teaches you step-by-step how to make £20,951 per month (without getting banned).

***

Adam Cheng quit his job and started betting full-time in May 2017.

This was a huge risk, as he was the main bread-winner for his wife and young daughter.

But despite this pressure, he has:

- sustained a **full-time living** from betting

- banked a total of **£500,000**

- averaged **£21,951** per month

- made **£73,000** in a single month

- had **32 out of 35** winning months

No wonder he's got a smile on his face...

![adamface](/img/adamface.png)

<!-- After seeing these results, I approahched Adam and asked him to share his process with me.

Adam agreed, and after six months of in-depth discussions, weekly recordings, writing pages and pages of guides, and testing it all on real-life betting examples, we've transformed his entire approach into a step-by-step process anyone can follow.

The result is **Adam Cheng's Football Beting Masterclass**. And today we'd like to invite you to become a student.

-->

Now, through his masterclass, Adam's sharing every step of his betting process so you can follow in his footsteps and take your betting game to the next level.

## What will I get out of this?

Here are the goals of Adam's masterclass:

- Teach you every step of Adam's betting process

- Show you his exact strategy for making an average of £20,951 per month

- Reveal his secrets for dodging the bookie' ban hammer, so you can stop getting your accounts restricted

- Help you get off the tipster merry-go-round and learn to make betting decisions yourself

- Show you how to use the laws of probability as a mental superpower for betting consistently

- Give you access to a community of fellow students who are learning to use Adam's methods together

- Squeeze every ounce of betting knowledge out of Adam and transform it into practical, easy to follow steps for you to follow

- Give you full access to all the 'behind the scenes' discussions between me and Adam, so no valuable insight is hidden from you

- Supply you with tools to help automate parts of Adam's strategy

## What is a 'masterclass'?

It's a learning program designed to break down exactly how a master of a specific skill does what they do, so you can learn from the best to improve your own skill.

In this case, Adam will share with you every step of his betting process, from the philosophies that underpin every bet he makes, to his exact strategies, and everthing in between.

No rock is left unturned. By the end of this masterclass you'll know how to bet exactly like Adam, who makes an average of £20,951 per month.

## What is included?

Each lesson includes a mix of:

<svg class="fill-current text-indigo-700 h-24 w-24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20"><path d="M16 8A6 6 0 1 0 4 8v11H2a2 2 0 0 1-2-2v-4a2 2 0 0 1 2-2V8a8 8 0 1 1 16 0v3a2 2 0 0 1 2 2v4a2 2 0 0 1-2 2h-2V8zm-4 2h3v10h-3V10zm-7 0h3v10H5V10z"/></svg>

### Audio discussions

This is the core of each lesson.

Instead of scripted videos with canned information like in most courses, here you get to hear mine and Adam's full uncensored discussion on each lesson topic.

After 7 years working with professional bettors and quizzing them on their methods, I discovered that the most valuable insights arise through discussion.

Often pros like Adam are so immersed in what they do, they can't see that what's "common knowledge" to them is actually a hugely valuable insight for regular punters.

For example, during the audio dicscussion for **Lesson 6: How to Compile Odds Like a Master Bookmaker** Adam mentions how he uses restricted accounts to manipulate bookmaker odds, and how this adds an extra £80 or so profit to his bets. "Free money" as he called it.

To him this was no big deal, but to me (and the average punter) this was hugely exciting.

Who doesn't want to add an extra £80 to their bets?

So, thanks to this unscripted discussion I was able to turn this little gem into a mini strategy where I break down the exact steps to do this yourself.

You'll find it in the "Do this" section of the guide for **Lesson 6**.

Another benefit of the audio format is that you can listen to these discussions wherever you are and whatever you're doing.

You can improve your betting while your driving, washing up, relaxing on the sofa, going for a walk... even on the toilet...

Just pop a pair of headphones in and the whole world becomes your learning playground!

### Guides

This is where I turn Adam's insights, advice, and strategies into practical, easy to follow steps you can implement in your own betting.

Each guide is made up of these sections:

- **"Main takeaways"**
  
  This is where I summarise Adam's key insights from the lesson in easy to digest bullet points

- **"Do this"**
  
  Here I turn Adam's advice into step-by-step mini strategies and excecises to help reifnorce his teachings and make sure you can implement them in your own betting as easily as possible

- **"Read this"**
  
  This is where I provide extra learning material or links to software that can help you further understand and implement Adam's teachings

- **"What's next?"**
  
  A quick tease of what you'll discover in the next lesson (which, if you like, you can get stuck into straight awway)

- **"Highlight reel"**
  
  Adam's most important and insightful quotes from the discussion. I've also made every quote into audio clips you can listen to for quick-fire inspiration and advice

- **"Timestamps"**
  
  A list of the topics we talk about in the audio discussion and at what times

The "Main takeaways" and "Do this" sections are where you'll find the main bulk of the action in the guides.

But the extra reading is hugely valuable too.

Think of it like an ongoing reading club where we explore interesting (and sometimes wacky) ideas that give you new 'lenses' to look at your betting through.

### Video walkthroughs

The first 6 lessons include video walkthroughs with me.

I break down the main takweays for each lesson, summarise Adam's advice, and walk you through the practical actions to take to improve your own betting found in the guide.

The 7th lesson, where we breakdown Adam's main strategy step-by-step includes video wlakthroughs with Adam.

I thought this would be the best way to show you exactly how Adam implements these strategies himself.

### Highlight clips

These audio clips are bite-size outtakes from the main audio discussion.

They're the most impactful and valuable insights Adam shared in the lesson.

If you ever need a rerfresher on a lesson, or just some quick-fire advice from Adam, you can play a few of these clips.

Yep, you'll be able to improve your betting in as little as 60 seconds!

<svg class="fill-current text-indigo-700 h-24 w-24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 20 20"><path d="M3.94 6.5L2.22 3.64l1.42-1.42L6.5 3.94c.52-.3 1.1-.54 1.7-.7L9 0h2l.8 3.24c.6.16 1.18.4 1.7.7l2.86-1.72 1.42 1.42-1.72 2.86c.3.52.54 1.1.7 1.7L20 9v2l-3.24.8c-.16.6-.4 1.18-.7 1.7l1.72 2.86-1.42 1.42-2.86-1.72c-.52.3-1.1.54-1.7.7L11 20H9l-.8-3.24c-.6-.16-1.18-.4-1.7-.7l-2.86 1.72-1.42-1.42 1.72-2.86c-.3-.52-.54-1.1-.7-1.7L0 11V9l3.24-.8c.16-.6.4-1.18.7-1.7zM10 13a3 3 0 1 0 0-6 3 3 0 0 0 0 6z"/></svg>

### Tools

Okay, maybe they're more like SUPER spreadsheets.

But seriously... they're actually very exciting!

One is an exact replica of Adam's personal spreadsheet, which is where he records specific data each Monday morning that helps him get his edge over bookmakers.

With this template you can track the same stats and data As Adam and implement his main strategy exactly like he does (details on Adam's betting routine are in **Lesson 1: A Bird's Eye View of Adam's Approach**).

The two other spreadsheets provide some small visual tools to help you fast-track parts of Adam's main betting strategy, which we go into in **Lesson 7: Adam's £20,951 per Month Super Strategy**.

They also contain data for the example bets we cover in that lesson, so you can see the full process of how Adam uses data to inform each bet.

This data is also reusable for any bets you want to place on these specific teams (Wolverhampton and Norwich).

These spreadsheets are just a little extra to make things easier for you.

### Private members community

Plus, you'll receive an invite to join our private Telegram community.

This is where we work as a group to implement Adam's advice and strategies.

And also test out new ideas that anyone throws into the mix.

We have two pro punters already part of the group, so the level of insight being shared is top notch.

See the later section on this page, [Can I chat with other students?](#), for more info on the community.

Breathe!

I know... that's a lot of content.

But you can take things at your own pace.

The course is designed to introduce you to each of Adam's main betting concepts one by one, so you can get to grips with one before moving onto the next.

And remember, because the core of each lesson is the audio discussion, you're never tied to your computer when learning Adam's insights.

You can listen wherever you are and whatever you're doing - provided your ears are free!

You can also chat with our growing community about the new concepts you're learning from Adam, so you're never alone.

We'll be improving our betting knoweldge and results togeher!

## Can I see Adam's full track record?

Sure.

As the table shows, Adam's had 32 out of 35 profitable months.

That's a positive monthly strike rate of 90%.

And, to give you an idea of the kind of profits he's making per bet, here are some of his betting slips:

<div class="border-2 shadow-md">

![adambet1](/img/adambet1.png)

</div>
<br>
<div class="border-2 shadow-md">

</div>
<br>
<div class="border-2 shadow-md">

![adambet1](/img/adambet3.png)

</div>

Remember, Adam stakes big because he's so confident in his edge.

But even with smaller stakes, his strategies are hugely profitable.

For example, the above bets would have turned:

£15 into **£234**.

£75 into **£678**.

And £150 into **£783**.

So, even if you're staking £10 to £15 per bet, you can still make a very tidy return following Adam's strategies and guidance.

## Can anyone do this?

I'll be blunt...

**Adam Cheng's Football Betting Masterclass** isn't for everyone.

In fact, I imagine most people will be put off by the idea of studying to improve their betting - even if it's just 15 mins per day.

And even if the result could be banking as much as £20,951 per month.

And that's fair enough.

If you're happy just following someone else’s tips for the rest of your betting career then this probably isn’t for you.

This masterclass is designed for a different kind of person.

Someone who understands that putting a little bit of work in now can lead to huge returns in the future.

Like our early access member Neel Shah, who has recently gone full-time with his betting. 

As Neel says...

> The core of the course was about learning. There were actionable strategies that were simple to understand that could be applied straight away.
> 
> "I really liked the homework exercises and recommended reading. This gave the course and the air of academics and reinforce the idea that this is something that requires effort and cannot be followed by blindly.

Does that sound like something you can get on board with?

If so, then joining **Adam Cheng's Football Betting Masterclass** has some serious benefits.

You can expect to:

- Turn your betting into a real second income

- Make as much as £20,951 per month like Adam

- Never pay for a tipster service again

- Fit your whole betting approach into as little as 15 mins per day
  
- Stop getting restricted like all the mug punters out there
  
Hell, once you've experienced Adam's teachings you could even go on to have your own tipping service!

Imagine people paying you for your betting advice.

That's the level of expertise this masterclass is designed to help you develop.

And it all starts when you get your name down today.

## How about if I only stake small?

As you can see from the bet examples above, Adam often stakes £500+ on each bet.

This is because he's extremely confident in the edge he has (the same one he helps you develop throughout his masterclass).

But there's no reason for you to bet with such large stakes.

In fact, Adam says that smaller stakes and a smaller betting bank can actually be better for his strategies.

Why?

Because niche markets like the ones Adam bets on have a natural limit to stake sizes - either the bookmaker forces it or you have to stay small to fly under their radar anyway.

So, even though your stakes might be smaller than Adam's, they can be a larger proportion of your betting bank.

And your relative profits will be greater than Adam's!

## What if my accounts are restricted?

This is a huge issue all bettors are facing right now.

Instead of hiring people with the skill to price up markets properly, bookmakers have resorted to swinging the ban hammer at anyone who makes a profit.

Yuck!

The good news is in **Lesson 3: How Adam Dodges the Bookie Ban Hammer** Adam shares all of his bookie dodging secrets.

And, boy, are some of these off the charts in terms of creativity!

Sure, like anyone Adam's bettting accounts eventually get restricted.

But since 2017 he's been able to sustain making an average of £20,951 per month.

That's because he's developed many tricks and tactics for going unnoticed by bookmakers and keeping his accounts open for as long as possible.

If you'd like more details on what adam does, check out the breakdown of **Lesson 3** in the [What will I learn in each lesson?](#) section on this page.

Adam even shows you the best way to go about getting other people to open accounts for you - even if you've never met them before.

<div class="bg-yellow-50 p-4 shadow-md">

**Note:** Our bookie ban hammer dodging lesson was actually indended to come later in the masterclass, but an early access member requested we bring it forward - and, of course, we complied.

This shows two things:

1. Getting restrictions is a hot issue for many people (so, you're not alone)
2. We put our members first! In fact, the whole masterclass is an effort to do this

</div>

## Can I chat with other students?

No speaking in class!

Only joking.

We have a private Telegram group exclusive for masterclass members.

This is where we help each other implement Adam's methods, plus also discuss and share other betting approaches and strategies.

For example, here's two of our early access members making profits on their very first bets using Adam's "weird arrow" strategy...

![fredwinner](/img/fredwinner.png)

Here's me sharing some Monday morning passes market analysis...

![meanalysis](/img/meanalysis.png)

And here's our member Paul getting stuck in with his own analysis...

![paulanalysis](/img/paulanalysis.png)

With pro bettor Josh Allen and aspiring pro Neel Shah as part of the group, there's a lot of expert knowledge and enthusiasm knocking around.

For example, here's Neel and I discussing the impact of empty stadiums during COVID lockdown matches...

![neelanalysis](/img/neelanalysis.png)

Surrouding yourself with the right people is an essential part of taking your betting to the next level.

And we're building a community of bettors who want to make more money in less time, and have fun while they're doing it.

You're more than welcome to join us.

## Who are you?

My name's Duncan Moreland.

I don't expect you to have heard of me, although I've been part of the betting industry for going on 8 years now.

I'm what they call a "ghost writer" because I write on behalf of professional bettors (and investors in the finance world).

I've written for horse racing tipsters Miles Tredwell, Mel Gee, and Nick Pullen, Football Index tipster Adam Gibbs, BetChat's Josh Allen (when he's too busy down the boozer), plus plenty of anonymous tipsters in greyhound racing, golf, tennis.

I've also written on behalf of some bigwig financial investors, including New York Times best-selling authors Jim Rickards and James Altucher.

In other words, I've been knocking around as a writer in the betting and finance industries for quite a while.

But this is one of the first projects where I've brought myself into the mix in a small way.

I'm no professional bettor so I act as the 'idiot' who Adam has to explain every part of his betting process to in simple, easy to follow language.

This means that anyone, no matter their experience, will be able to get a lot out of Adam's masterclass - especially with the practical, easy to follow lesson guides and video walkthroughs.

I really poured all my effort into making this masterclass the best it could be for anybody who chooses to give it a go.

So, do let me know what you think - even if you just dip into the free intro lesson.

## How much is this?

I don't like it when people mess around with pricing, so here you go:

**Adam Cheng's Football Betting Masterclass** is £250+VAT.

Including the VAT, it's just shy of £300.

That's a one-time price with no recurring fees.

If you're used to paying £47 per month for tipster services, this amount of money in one go may seem like a lot.

But consider this:

**You may never need to subscribe to a tipster service again.**

The average tipster service is £47 per month, which is £564 per year.

Five years of subscribing would be £2,820.

Yikes... better hope they're profitable!

Plus, most people subscribe to more than one tipster service.

So, you can see how expensive relying on others to find you profitable bets can be.

The content in **Adam Cheng's Football Masterclass** is designed to help you step off the tipster merry-go-round and show you how to find profitable bets for yourself.

You'll be able to follow in Adam's footsteps and potentially make as much as £20,951 per month - without getting banned!

As I say, this won't be for everyone.

But for the right person Adam's masterclass is an absolute bargain.

Think of this as an investment in your betting future.

As our member Neel says:

> This is a course with actual principles to learn. While there's so much crap out there that punters can smell a mile away... this just feels legitimate.

And our early access member Paul has kind words about the masterclass too...

</div>

## Can I pay in installments?

Sure, I set up a 3-part payment option for one of our early access members.

At £100+VAT per month, it does work out a bit more expensive than buying Adam's masterclass in one go.

But I understand that due to COVID the year has been financially tough on many people, so this option is here if you want it.

## Is there a money-back guarantee?

Yes.

You'll have 7 days to try out **Adam Cheng's Football Betting Masterclass**.

This is enough time to get stuck into the material and go through some of the lessons to decide for yourself what you think.

You can also join the Telegram community in this time, to get a feel for what we're trying to do there (if you want to).

If you decide the masterclass isn't for you, just drop me an email at [hellobetmentor@gmail.com](mailto:hellobetmentor@gmail.com) or send me a message on Telegram within the 7 days and I'll give you a full refund.

And if you're a few hours over the time limit...

I'll prob still give you a refund because I'm a generous soul!

If you're on the fence about trying the masterclass, the best thing to do first is go through the free intro lesson.

## Can I buy lessons individually?

Not at the moment.

The course was designed as a whole, with each lesson building on the next.

That said, many of the lessons contain standalanone secrets, insights, and advice that will help improve your betting even if you're not going through the masterclass in order.

For example, **Lesson 3: How Adam Dodges the Bookie Ban Hammer** shows you little-known secrets for avoiding bookie restrictions - something every punter would benefit from.

And **Lesson 5: The Power of Probability, Adam's Secret Weapon** is also applicable to all areas of your betting.

In fact, really taking on board the insights in that lesson could completely tranform the way you look at betting forever.

So, tell you what...

If you are interested in buying any of the lessons seperately, shoot me an email at [hellobetmentor@gmail.com](mailto:hellobetmentor@gmail.com) and I'll see what I can do.

## Does this have super duper production values?

Nope.

In fact, unlike most online courses out there, this is a bit "rough and ready"

But, I actually see that as a good thing.

Too many online courses focus on the wrong stuff:

- Short videos that promote surface level understanding

- Production value over valuable content

- Canned scripts that feel impersonal and robotic

- Video camera pointing at somebody’s face (I’m not learning a lot from your eyebrows…)

- And slides, slides, ENDLESS slides (did I mention slides?)

In my opinion, no one should be paying a premium price for a glorified PowerPoint presentation - especially if all you’re left with is a surface level understanding and no real skill development.

Working with Adam, I knew we could do better.

That's why we give you full access to all the recordings of our dicussions about his betting approach.

No secret or insight is hidden from you - especially because I constantly push Adam to break down exactly how he does things.

Then, of course, I turn all Adam's insights into practical step-by-step strategies and takeaways you can easily follow to improve your own betting.

So, you get the best of both worlds:

Full "behind the scenes" access to every part of Adam's betting.

And practical step-by-step instructions you can follow to copy everything he's doing.

Does that sound good?
